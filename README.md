## *Algorithms in C++* Algorithms in Ruby

This is an ongoing project to translate the algorithms presented in Robert Sedgewick's *Algorithms in C++* into Ruby using TDD with minitest. I'm doing this to get accustomed to TDD, expand my Ruby knowledge, and to work my way through this fantastic book.

My procedure is to port Sedgewick's algorithms as directly as possible into Ruby as a classes with tests, and then to make the code more idiomatic to Ruby wherever possible.

I may include my solutions to exercises from the text wherever appropriate, but we'll see how this goes. This is a work in progress.

## Installation and Testing

Clone this repository and do with it what you will. Run the tests by simply running each test file, e.g. `ruby quickfind_test.rb`.

## Contributions

I would greatly appreciate any feedback! Raise an issue or submit a PR.
